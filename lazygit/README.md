# Lazygit

To use this configuration, create a symlink from Lazygit's config file
to the `config.yaml` file in this directory.

By default, [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) looks for its configuration
in `~/Library/Application\ Support/lazygit/config.yml` on MacOS.

Run this command to link it:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/config.yml" ~/Library/Application\ Support/lazygit/config.yml
```
