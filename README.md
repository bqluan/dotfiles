# Dotfiles symlinked on my machine

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various
tools and applications. These configurations are symlinked to their respective
locations on my machines.

Each directory contains configuration files for a specific tool/application along
with its own README explaining the setup.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository to your desired location
2. Review each tool's README for specific installation instructions
3. Symlink the configurations to their appropriate system locations

## About These Configs

These dotfiles represent my personal preferences and workflow optimizations.
They're shared:

- As a backup for my own use across machines
- As an example for others to draw inspiration from
- With the understanding that they may need adaptation for different environments

## Maintenance

I periodically update these configurations as my workflow evolves. Major changes
are documented in the respective tool's README.
