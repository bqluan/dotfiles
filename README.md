# Dotfiles symlinked on my machine

Each directory contains configuration files for a specific tool/application along
with its own README explaining the setup.

## About These Configs

These dotfiles represent my personal preferences and workflow optimizations.
They're shared:

- As a backup for my own use across machines
- As an example for others to draw inspiration from
- With the understanding that they may need adaptation for different environments

## Maintenance

I periodically update these configurations as my workflow evolves. Major changes
are documented in the respective tool's README.
