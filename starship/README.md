# Starship

To use this configuration, create a symlink from Starship's config file
to the `starship.toml` file in this directory.

By default, [Starship](https://starship.rs) looks for its configuration
in `~/.config/starship.toml`.

Run this command to link it:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/starship.toml" ~/.config/starship.toml
```
